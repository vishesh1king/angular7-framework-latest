This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.0-next.3(Angular 10).

This is a simple angular framework with all the must use features and structures. Below are the features of this framework,

  - Lazy Loading
  - PWA (Progressive Web Applications) enabled
  - Router auth gaurd (canActivate & canDeactivate)
  - Default error routing done for invalid paths
  - HTTP client module
  - HTTP client module interceptor
  - Sample API Implemented
  - Included latest angular meterial
  - Included shared modules

### Lazy Loading

By lazy-loading a module we can tell Angular to load it only when its route is been visited, meaning that its weight wonâ€™t affect the size of your application at startup.

Lazy loading is simply a diffent way of adding your routing and modules. In this framework the folowing is done to demonstrate the lazy loading.

1. There are two modules **app.module.ts** and **parent.module.ts**. they have there out routers and include their dependant components.
2. When agular loads the parent component is not loaded since the app.module include parent component as a child route in **app-routing.module.ts**.

        {path:'jokes', loadChildren:'./parent-component/parent-component.module#ParentComponentModule'},
    
3. Thus only then the route is changed to "/jokes". The parent module is loaded. This is it !!! You can add more heirarchy and create efficient application like this.

### PWA (Progressive Web Applications) enabled

You can look at what is PWA and how you can test [PWA]. This basically uses extensive browser caching methods and keeps the site alive without re-reneding components. This will impact the site performance largely.

### Router auth gaurd (canActivate & canDeactivate)

For security many application will require the auth gaurds. We can test the vailidity of the URL or token whenever there is a change in route.

    {path: '', component: ParentComponentComponent, canActivate: [AuthGaurdService], canDeactivate: [AuthGaurdService]},

The AuthGaurdService is a injectable service where the code for canavtivate and canDeactivate is written.

### Default error routing done for invalid paths

In routers if any invalid route is given. The page will redirect to 404.

### HTTP client module

A HTTP client module is must for latest versions of angular. The HTTP client module has been added for the HTTP requests in this framework.

### HTTP client module interceptor

**app-http.interceptor** is a interceptor for HTTP client module. Tis intercector is like a middleware, we can perform common activities like showing / hiding loading icon before and after HTTP requests.

This interceptor is added in the app modules.

    providers: [
        { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: MyHttpInterceptor, multi: true }
    ],

### Sample API Implemented

A sample API has been added. This api is called in parent component. The service file name is **jokes.service.ts**.

### Included latest angular meterial

The site is designed with angular material. The buttons, listing, etc.. are done using latest angular material 7.3.7.

### Included shared modules

Most of the time in any given application you will have to use common components like Headers, Loading, etc. These remail common accross all modules. Thus here a shared module is created and imported in the modules that require it. The file name is **app.shared.module.ts**.






## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
